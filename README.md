# Exploring-and-Applying-Python-Stacks-and-Queues
'''This is a compilation of Python programs based on the website https://realpython.com/queue-in-python/. It covers the topics:
(1) Various types of Queues and Implement Queue Data Type
(2) Solve practical problems by applying the right queue
(3) Use Python’s thread-safe, asynchronous, and interprocess queues
(4) Integrate Python with distributed message queue brokers through libraries '''


# The Application of Different Queues
''' About: This program includes implementing Queue data type, Stack data type, Priority Queues with Heap, Tuples, Priority Queue data type, and Refactor using Mixin class. '''

# Working With Thread-Safe Queues - FIFO And LIFO
'''This program includes implementing Thread-Safe Queues, particularly in FIFO Queue and LIFO Queue. Note: When testing to run the LIFO Queue, go over to the def parse_args() and change the default to lifo. '''

# Working With Thread-Safe Queues - PriorityQueue
'''This program includes implementing Thread-Safe Queues, particularly in PriorityQueue. '''
